#Fuzzy Viewshed Calculator
This project implements a Fuzzy Viewshed Calculator that uses a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to calculate viewsheds with fuzzy logic principles. The calculation of fuzzy viewsheds follows the methodology proposed by Ogburn, D. E. (2006). Assessing the level of visibility of cultural objects in past landscapes. Journal of Archaeological Science, 33(3), 405-413. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2005.08.005
